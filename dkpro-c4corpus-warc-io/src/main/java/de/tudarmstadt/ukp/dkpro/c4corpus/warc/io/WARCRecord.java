/**
 * Immutable implementation of a record in a WARC file. You create a {@link WARCRecord}
 * by parsing it out of a {@link DataInput} stream.
 * <br>
 * The file format is documented in the
 * [ISO Standard](http://bibnum.bnf.fr/warc/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf).
 * In a nutshell, it's a textual format consisting of lines delimited by `\r\n`.
 * Each record has the following structure:
 * <br>
 * 1. A line indicating the WARC version number, such as `WARC/1.0`.
 * 2. Several header lines (in key-value format, similar to HTTP or email headers),
 * giving information about the record. The header is terminated by an empty line.
 * 3. A body consisting of raw bytes (the number of bytes is indicated in one of the headers).
 * 4. A final separator of `\r\n\r\n` before the next record starts.
 * <br>
 * There are various different types of records, as documented on
 * {@link Header#getRecordType()}.

         * <br>
         * *  `warcinfo`: Describes the records that follow it, up through end of file,
         * end of input, or until next `warcinfo` record. Typically, this appears once and
         * at the beginning of a WARC file. For a web archive, it often contains information
         * about the web crawl which generated the following records.
         * <br>
         * The format of this descriptive record block may vary, though the use of the
         * `"application/warc-fields"` content-type is recommended. (...)
         * <br>
         * *  `response`: The record should contain a complete scheme-specific response, including
         * network protocol information where possible. For a target-URI of the `http` or
         * `https` schemes, a `response` record block should contain the full HTTP
         * response received over the network, including headers. That is, it contains the
         * 'Response' message defined by section 6 of HTTP/1.1 (RFC2616).
         * <br>
         * The WARC record's Content-Type field should contain the value defined by HTTP/1.1,
         * `"application/http;msgtype=response"`. The payload of the record is defined as its
         * 'entity-body' (per RFC2616), with any transfer-encoding removed.
         * <br>
         * *  `resource`: The record contains a resource, without full protocol response
         * information. For example: a file directly retrieved from a locally accessible
         * repository or the result of a networked retrieval where the protocol information
         * has been discarded. For a target-URI of the `http` or `https` schemes, a `resource`
         * record block shall contain the returned 'entity-body' (per RFC2616, with any
         * transfer-encodings removed), possibly truncated.
         * <br>
         * *  `request`: The record holds the details of a complete scheme-specific request,
         * including network protocol information where possible. For a target-URI of the
         * `http` or `https` schemes, a `request` record block should contain the full HTTP
         * request sent over the network, including headers. That is, it contains the
         * 'Request' message defined by section 5 of HTTP/1.1 (RFC2616).
         * <br>
         * The WARC record's Content-Type field should contain the value defined by HTTP/1.1,
         * `"application/http;msgtype=request"`. The payload of a `request` record with a
         * target-URI of scheme `http` or `https` is defined as its 'entity-body' (per
         * RFC2616), with any transfer-encoding removed.
         * <br>
         * *  `metadata`: The record contains content created in order to further describe,
         * explain, or accompany a harvested resource, in ways not covered by other record
         * types. A `metadata` record will almost always refer to another record of another
         * type, with that other record holding original harvested or transformed content.
         * <br>
         * The format of the metadata record block may vary. The `"application/warc-fields"`
         * format may be used.
         * <br>
         * *  `revisit`: The record describes the revisitation of content already archived,
         * and might include only an abbreviated content body which has to be interpreted
         * relative to a previous record. Most typically, a `revisit` record is used
         * instead of a `response` or `resource` record to indicate that the content
         * visited was either a complete or substantial duplicate of material previously
         * archived.
         * <br>
         * A `revisit` record shall contain a WARC-Profile field which determines the
         * interpretation of the record's fields and record block. Please see the
         * specification for details.
         * <br>
         * *  `conversion`: The record shall contain an alternative version of another
         * record's content that was created as the result of an archival process.
         * Typically, this is used to hold content transformations that maintain viability
         * of content after widely available rendering tools for the originally stored
         * format disappear. As needed, the original content may be migrated (transformed)
         * to a more viable format in order to keep the information usable with current
         * tools while minimizing loss of information.
         * <br>
         * *  `continuation`: Record blocks from `continuation` records must be appended to
         * corresponding prior record blocks (eg. from other WARC files) to create the
         * logically complete full-sized original record. That is, `continuation`
         * records are used when a record that would otherwise cause a WARC file size to
         * exceed a desired limit is broken into segments. A continuation record shall
         * contain the named fields `WARC-Segment-Origin-ID` and `WARC-Segment-Number`,
         * and the last `continuation` record of a series shall contain a
         * `WARC-Segment-Total-Length` field. Please see the specification for details.
         * <br>
